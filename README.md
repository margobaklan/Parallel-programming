## Floyd-Warshall Algorithm: Sequential and Parallel Implementation
### Overview
This project implements the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.
It includes both sequential and parallel implementations, where the parallel version utilizes distributed workers via PARCS (Python) to efficiently compute large graphs.
### Usage
For parallel execution, this project uses PARCS (Python), available at:
https://github.com/Hummer12007/parcs-python.git

Using PARCS you can create distributed workers, manage jobs, and upload solvers and input files.
